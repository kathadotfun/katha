# Katha

Katha is a provenance and ownership platform for Nepal's cultural art. It connects
documented physical works to verifiable digital identities so collectors can
discover, own, preserve, and resell authentic pieces while the artist's authorship
remains permanent.

The first release focuses on Mandala, Paubha, and Thangka artworks. One documented
physical artwork maps to one permanent Katha ID and one Metaplex Core asset on
Solana Devnet.

## What the MVP will prove

The Devnet MVP follows one complete artwork lifecycle:

```text
artist and artwork documentation
  -> Katha authentication and condition inspection
  -> permanent Katha ID and Core asset
  -> NFC discovery
  -> primary purchase by Wallet A
  -> condition-aware resale
  -> purchase by Wallet B
  -> preserved authorship, custody, and provenance
```

Katha records claims made through a physical verification process. Blockchain
records make those claims and later ownership changes tamper-evident; they do not
independently prove that a physical artwork is authentic. NFC is a stable discovery
bridge to the artwork record, not proof by itself.

## Project status

Katha is under active development. This repository currently contains the public
product specification, architecture decisions, repository safeguards, a pinned
pnpm workspace, shared strict TypeScript presets, lint/format checks, task
orchestration, a minimal Next.js web scaffold, and a bare Hono API service. The
artwork browsing and provenance experience, API behavior, database, and Solana
program behavior described in the specification remain planned until implemented
and tested.

The MVP targets local development and a reproducible Solana Devnet demonstration.
Hosted production deployment, mainnet, production payment economics, auctions,
fractional ownership, embedded wallets, and automated physical settlement are
outside the current scope.
